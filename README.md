## 1 Introduction

The Quizzer is a web application that can be used in bars, sports canteens and maybe even prisons to play quizzes as a team. A pub quiz, basically.

There are 3 main roles in this application: The Quizz Master, The Team and The Scoreboard. The idea is that the Quizz Master can host a room which players can join. A game of Quizzer can be played with a minimum of 2 players and a maximum of 6. The game consists of 12 questions per round and can be played indefinitely untill the Quizz Master ends the quiz after the last question of a round. The question, team answers and points are all shown on the scoreboard screen which is updated in near real-time.
